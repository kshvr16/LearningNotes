# Data Types and Operators

-----------------
### 1. Introduction
__Data Types and Operators__
Welcome to this lesson on Data Types and Operators! In this lesson, you will learn how to write basic Python statements using building blocks like the print statement, variables, and different data types.

Here are the topics you'll learn about:
- Data Types: Integers, Floats, Booleans, Strings
- Operators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical
- Built-In Functions, Type Conversion
- Whitespace and Style Guidelines

__Print Statements__
```print ()``` - built-in function that displays input values as text in the output

### 2. Arthimetic Operators
__Arthimetic Operators__
- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Mod (the remainder after dividing)
- `**` Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
- `//` Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

The usual order of mathematical operations holds in Python, often referred to as __PEMDAS: *Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction*__.
If needed, you can review the order of mathematical operations in this Wikipedia article [Order of Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations).
__Bitwise operators__ are special operators in Python that you can learn more about [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) if you'd like.
